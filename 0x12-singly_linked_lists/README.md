Linked List 

A linked list is a linear data structure (like arrays) where each element is a separate object. A linked list is made up of two items that are data and a reference to the next node. A reference to the next node is given with the help of pointers and data is the value of a node. Each node contains data and links to the other nodes. It is an ordered collection of data elements called a node and the linear order is maintained by pointers. It has an upper hand over the array as the number of nodes i.e. the size of the linked list is not fixed and can grow and shrink as and when required, unlike arrays. 

Singly Linked List: In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of the next node in the list and the last node has the next address or reference as NULL. For example 1->2->3->4->NULL.
